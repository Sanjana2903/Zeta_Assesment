## Microsoft + GitHub = Empowering Developers

Today, we announced an agreement to acquire GitHub, the world’s leading software development platform. I want to share what this acquisition will mean for our industry and for developers.
The era of the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge is upon us. Computing is becoming embedded in the world, with every part of our daily life and work and every aspect of our society and economy being transformed by digital technology.
Developers are the builders of this new era, writing the world’s code. And GitHub is their home.
As every industry – from precision medicine to precision agriculture, from personalized education to personalized banking – is being impacted by technology, the developer community will only grow in numbers and importance. Developer workflows will drive and influence business processes and functions across the organization – from marketing, sales and service, to IT and HR. And value creation and growth across every industry will increasingly be determined by the choices developers make.
In short, developers will be at the center of solving the world’s most pressing challenges. However, the real power comes when every developer can create together, collaborate, share code and build on each other’s work. In all walks of life, we see the power of communities, and this is true for software development and developers.
That is why we are so excited about today’s announcement. More than 28 million developers already collaborate on GitHub, and it is home to more than 85 million code repositories used by people in nearly every country. From the largest corporations to the smallest startups, GitHub is the destination for developers to learn, share and work together to create software. It’s a destination for Microsoft too. We are the most active organization on GitHub, with more than 2 million “commits,” or updates, made to projects.
Microsoft has been a developer-focused company from the very first product we created to the platforms and tools we offer today. Building technology so that others can build technology is core to our mission to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
Microsoft is also committed to empowering communities, from the world’s professionals to IT professionals to gamers. We believe in the power of communities to achieve much more than what their members can do on their own. It’s our ability to work together that helps our dreams become reality, and we are dedicated to cultivating and growing communities to do just that.
And Microsoft is all-in on open source. We have been on a journey with open source, and today we are active in the open source ecosystem, we contribute to open source projects, and some of our most vibrant developer tools and frameworks are open source. When it comes to our commitment to open source, judge us by the actions we have taken in the recent past, our actions today, and in the future.
Given all of this, together with GitHub, we see three clear opportunities ahead.
First, we will empower developers at every stage of the development lifecycle – from ideation to collaboration to deployment to the cloud. Going forward, GitHub will remain an open platform, which any developer can plug into and extend. Developers will continue to be able to use the programming languages, tools and operating systems of their choice for their projects – and will still be able to deploy their code on any cloud and any device.
Second, we will accelerate enterprise developers’ use of GitHub, with our direct sales and partner channels and access to Microsoft’s global cloud infrastructure and services.
Finally, we will bring Microsoft’s developer tools and services to new audiences.
Most importantly, we recognize the responsibility we take on with this agreement. We are committed to being stewards of the GitHub community, which will retain its developer-first ethos, operate independently and remain an open platform. We will always listen to developer feedback and invest in both fundamentals and new capabilities.
Once the acquisition closes later this year, GitHub will be led by CEO Nat Friedman, an open source veteran and founder of Xamarin, who will continue to report to Microsoft Cloud + AI Group Executive Vice President Scott Guthrie; GitHub CEO and Co-Founder Chris Wanstrath will be a technical fellow at Microsoft, also reporting to Scott. You can see how Chris, Nat and I envision the opportunity ahead in this public presentation.
Together we will continue to advance GitHub as a platform loved by developers and trusted by organizations.

## Empowering people to do great work
On Thursday, Satya Nadella participated in the White House “Champions of Change” event, where President Obama honored individuals who have helped bring about change for working families within their companies, communities or organizations. Nadella introduced the President and spoke about the policy Microsoft recently announced to ensure our suppliers provide 15 days of annual paid time off to their U.S. employees who are doing substantial work for Microsoft.
I have always believed that technology has the potential to help people achieve their dreams and propel businesses and societies forward. I’ve seen this at work firsthand in my own life, in the lives of my family members and in the communities where I’ve lived — from Hyderabad, India, to Chicago, Ill., to Clyde Hill, Wash.
I now have the privilege to lead a team of innovative and passionate people who want to deliver technology that makes a meaningful impact in our world. This is the core of who we are at Microsoft. We aspire to empower every individual and every organization on the planet to achieve more.
We think about the word “empowering” expansively. Empowering everyone means building platforms and products for everyone — small-business owners, researchers, students, professionals, developers, entrepreneurs, people with any ability and people with any income level. It also means investing in the next generation and creating new job opportunities — from inspiring students to pursue careers in computer science to providing IT training for active duty military personnel to enter the civilian workforce.
We have big ambitions, and reaching them starts with empowering the people who work at Microsoft and the people who work on our behalf to bring their “A” game every day. We want people to be healthy and work in an inclusive environment that values diverse perspectives, experiences and backgrounds.
We also realize that a healthy work life extends outside the office walls. Microsoft has long provided industry-leading benefits to employees and their families, including comprehensive health and wellness programs, family care support, paid vacation time, paid sick leave, and paid leave for new parents. Our benefits extend to married couples and partners, whether same-sex or opposite-sex, and are designed to support and respond to the varying needs of our diverse workforce in meaningful ways. Over the past few months, as the national conversation about income inequality and the challenges facing workers and their families has intensified, we began to think more broadly about the people who do work on our behalf.
Like others, Microsoft relies on outside companies that provide us goods and services such as building maintenance, campus security and software localization. As we considered the contributions these individuals make, we concluded that the people who work for our suppliers are critical to our success, and we want them to have the benefit of paid time off.  As a result, last month we announced a policy to ensure that our suppliers provide at least 15 days of annual paid time off to their U.S. employees doing substantial work for Microsoft.
Paid time off is good for business — it’s been shown to lead to increased productivity for workers, improved employee retention and lower healthcare costs.
It’s also good for people and our society — paid time off supports healthier workers and families and stronger family ties. Moreover, lack of paid time off disproportionately impacts low-wage earners and minorities. According to one study, only 49 percent of people in the bottom quarter of earners get paid time off. As an industry and society, we can do more to help everyone reap the benefits of paid time off.
I want Microsoft to be a place where our employees and everyone who works on our behalf can bring their very best every day, and this policy change was the right next step for us. We hope that we can share our learnings and experiences with others and will continue to evolve our company to better serve and delight our customers.
It was a privilege and an honor to participate in the Champions of Change discussion at the White House to share why Microsoft is taking this step — just one in our journey to empower every individual and organization on the planet to achieve more.

## A cloud for everyone, on every device
In my initial remarks as CEO, I spoke about how Microsoft is embracing the new “mobile-first cloud-first” world. I’ve gotten great feedback around this declaration from customers, employees and partners who are excited to see us communicate this commitment so emphatically. I’ve also been asked a number of interesting questions about the language I used. A common one is actually the simplest and most important to answer: How can two things be first?
My honest answer is that I don’t think of the cloud and mobile as two things. They are two facets of one thing. The cloud was created to enable mobility. And mobile devices are really uninteresting without the cloud.
That’s why I talk about them together. Mobile without cloud is limiting. The cloud without mobile is mostly latent potential. But the place where they meet is magic. And in the full arc of time, we will get to a world of ubiquitous computing and ambient intelligence that powers all our daily experiences. That’s my focus for this blog post: not everything that Microsoft does but specifically how Microsoft’s cloud is enabling a world where mobile devices can do more and help people be more productive starting today.
We live in a world where device types, shapes, sizes and form factors are exploding and will continue to do so. Devices extend our abilities in ways that are uniquely suited to task, context and occasion. As long as human curiosity and ambition drive us to create new things, capture moments and collaborate to get things done, we should expect the world of devices to follow suit. In fact, that’s what drives our ongoing evolution of Windows: the desire to maximize the capabilities of these diverse device types while fitting perfectly into those unique moments and environments. But just because human activity will continue to be multidevice doesn’t mean we must tolerate islands of isolated capability. Instead, device diversification dramatically increases the importance of creating a more seamless experience. And the way we get there is through the cloud.
The cloud is how a phone, a tablet, a computer and a TV all get on the same page and enable movement between them without extra effort. The cloud is how a device becomes your device. And the cloud is how your device becomes part of your life, by connecting to all the people, information and experiences that matter to you. And for us, the cloud is also how a tablet becomes a useful and powerful tool.
So with that in mind, I’d like to talk about how we’re enabling a world in which anyone can make things happen, on their terms.
A great idea shouldn’t have to wait for you to get back to a particular device. An impromptu call with a customer shouldn’t be delayed because you don’t have the right data on hand. Life moves too fast to put limits on where and how you work. Just as the best camera is the one you have with you, sometimes the right device is the one closest at hand. Simply put, our vision is to deliver the best cloud-connected experience on every device.
We’re bringing Office, the gold standard in getting things done, to the iPad. A billion people rely on Office every day, and we’ve worked diligently to create a version of Word, Excel and PowerPoint that delivers the best productivity experience available on the iPad. It’s built from the ground up for touch, is unmistakably Office in its design, and is optimized for iPad. Office for iPad offers unmatched rendering of content and delivers unparalleled authoring, analysis and presentation experiences that Office customers expect on all of their devices. Download it today for free.
We’ve offered Office on the Mac for more than 20 years. Taking the next step and making it available for iPad users too is another way Office delivers on its promise to give anyone the power to make things, and make things happen, any moment of the day.
And we are fully committed to offering market-leading productivity solutions across all popular platforms and devices. Word, Excel and PowerPoint for iPad join other cross-platform apps including Skype, Dynamics, Xbox Music, Bing, Lync, Yammer, OneNote, Office Mobile for iPhone and Android phones, Mac Office, and Office Online. Our goal continues to be to delight users wherever they are and on whatever device they are using by giving them the full power of native Office apps.
Of course, people engage in an amazingly diverse array of activities on the job today, and it would be naive to think that Office could cover every task, scenario or requirement out of the box. That’s why developers are so important. They imagine and build the additional and more specialized capabilities that drive business forward. So we make the same platforms that we use to develop and deliver these cross-platform services available to developers. They can use Azure Mobile Services to build back-ends for iOS, Android and Windows devices. Azure AD API enables single sign-on and other directory services. We have APIs for all components of Office 365 including OneDrive, OneNote, Exchange and SharePoint so that any mobile application on any device platform can seamlessly access user data. Developers are living on the frontier of this mobile-first cloud-first world, and we’re committed to helping them make the most of their unique position and opportunity. They share our commitment and passion for giving people the power to get things done.
At the same time, that power needs to be managed. I’m sure you know the story of the “Sorcerer’s Apprentice.” It’s all great until it isn’t. And if management and security take more time and money than they save you, where’s the productivity gain?
That’s why we aren’t just focused on one dimension of the experience. The people who use apps and services want things to be seamless. One sign-on, one set of files, one consistent identity, regardless of device type. It’s a reasonable request, but the people who support these users know it isn’t always that simple. So we’re also introducing our new Enterprise Mobility Suite to make managing and securing these devices as easy as using them. So employees are free to go where they want, without data ending up where it shouldn’t. And it can also extend your enterprise identity to other apps and services like Salesforce.com, Box and Google Docs. Now, the same cloud that helps people get more done with less work will help IT do the same.
We’re a few days away from BUILD, our developer conference, where next week we’ll share where we’re going with key platforms like Windows, Windows Phone, Xbox and Azure. BUILD is also a great forum for highlighting one of the defining characteristics of our company: From our very first days as a company we have always been equally committed to meeting the diverse but intertwined needs of developers, businesses and the people who use our products. We unite these three audiences around a common set of experiences, technologies and tools. Tools for writing and deploying apps and services, tools for managing and securing devices and tools for getting things done. All working in concert with one another, all through the cloud. For the cloud to realize its full potential, the needs of these three constituencies must be addressed in a holistic, integrated way. Microsoft is in a unique position to do that.
The cloud is enabling a world where you can walk up to any supported device, sign in, collaborate, communicate and share your creations with the world. Doesn’t matter what you make, where you make it or what device you use. The cloud is there to help.
That’s where we’re headed together. Into a world where the devices you love work with the services you love in a way that IT and developers love. For work, play and everything in between.
